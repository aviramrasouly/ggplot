    This is an abstract base class for themes.

    In general, only complete themes should should subclass this class.


    Notes
    -----
    When subclassing there are really only two methods that need to be
    implemented.

    __init__: This should call super().__init__ which will define
    self._rcParams. Subclasses should customize self._rcParams after
    calling super().__init__. That will ensure that the rcParams are
    applied at the appropriate time.

    The other method is apply_more(ax). This method takes an axes
    object that has been created during the plot process. The theme
    should modify the axes according.

    """

    def __init__(self, complete=False, **kwargs):
        """
        Provide ggplot2 themeing capabilities.

        Parameters
        -----------
        complete : bool
            Themes that are complete will override any existing themes.
            themes that are not complete (ie. partial) will add to or
            override specific elements of the current theme.

            eg.
                theme_matplotlib() + theme_xkcd()

            will be completely determined by theme_xkcd, but

                (theme_matplotlib() +
                    theme(axis_text_x=element_text(angle=45)))

            will only modify the x axis text.

        kwargs**: themeables
            kwargs are themeables based on
            http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/theme.html.
            In addition, Python does not allow using '.' in argument
            names, so we are using '_' instead.

            For example, ggplot2 axis.ticks.y will be axis_ticks_y
            in Python ggplot.

            Many themeables are defined using theme elements i.e

                - element_line
                - element_rect
                - element_text

            These simply bind together all the aspects of a themeable
            that can be themed.
